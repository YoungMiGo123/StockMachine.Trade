The Buttonwood Agreement was signed by 24 stockbrokers who established a set up rules for organized securities trading in New York. Before this agreement, securities were sold auctioneers rather than on an organized market.\r\nOver the next 225 years the NYSE matured and evolved into what it is today. Over the first hundred years, restrictions against manipulative trading were added and more organized governance was developed.\r\nIn 1840, the invention of the telegraph allowed markets in New York and Philadelphia to consolidate. Over time trading practices have continued to evolve to take advantage of improved communication technologies and to keep up with growing demand.\r\nIn 1934, the Security Exchange Act as signed which created the SEC which regulates securities trading in the US.\r\nIn 2006, the NYSE merged with Archipelago Exchange (which is called NYSE Arca today). Through this deal, the NYSE became a for-profit, publicly traded company.\r\nOver the subsequent years there have been numerous mergers and acquisitions involving the NYSE and its subsidiaries. Today, the NYSE is operated by the Intercontinental Exchange.\r\nAbout the NYSE\r\nThe New York Stock Exchange is the largest stock exchange in the world. Located on Wall Street, in New York City, the NYSE lists some 2,300 companies and averages over $200 billion in daily trading value as of 2020.\r\nThe NYSE is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange, a company that operates 11 other exchanges and 6 clearing houses. The NYSE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\r\nThere are a number of other stock markets in the US, but the NYSE is seen as the the tried-and-true securities exchange. The NYSE is, and will continue, to be a backbone of the world's financial markets for decades to come.","TimeZone":"America/New_York\r\n(GMT-04:00)","MicCode":"XNYS","contactInfo":{"Description":null,"Address":"New York Stock Exchange\r\n11 Wall Street\r\nNew York, NY 10005","MarketComplianceEmail":"nysealert@nyse.com","ClientRelationshipServicesEmail":"crs@nyse.com","Website":"http://www.nyse.com/","ContactNumber":"+1 212-896-2830","Coordinates":""}},{"Country":"New York,\r\nUnited States üá∫üá∏","Market":null,"Overview":"Overview\r\nThe NASDAQ (NASDAQ) is based in New York, United States.
